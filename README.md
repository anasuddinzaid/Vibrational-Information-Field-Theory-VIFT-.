# Vibrational Information Field Theory (VIFT)

**Field:** Quantum Foundations / Information Theory / Unification

## ⚛️ The Fundamental Ontology
Physics has historically oscillated between particles and waves. **Vibrational Information Field Theory (VIFT)** proposes a third option: **Information**.

[cite_start]VIFT postulates that the most primitive constituent of reality is a constrained, scale-invariant **Information Field** ($\mathcal{I}$)[cite: 47, 60]. [cite_start]Matter, energy, and forces are not separate entities; they are "resonant modes" or localized vibrations of this field[cite: 60]. [cite_start]"Particles" are simply stable standing waves of information[cite: 65].

## 🌊 Reinterpreting Quantum Mechanics
VIFT removes the "spookiness" of quantum mechanics by reframing its core paradoxes through information dynamics:
* **Superposition as Isolation:** A system is not in a magical state of being "two things at once." Instead, superposition represents a state of **informational isolation**. [cite_start]It occurs when a vibrational mode is not exchanging data with its environment[cite: 896].
* **Measurement as Flux:** "Collapse" is not a random discontinuous jump. It is a physical process of **Information Flux**. [cite_start]When a system interacts with a detector, the isolation is broken, and information flows rapidly between the modes, forcing the system to "choose" a distinct state[cite: 897, 929].

## 🕰️ Relativity and Time Dilation
VIFT unifies Quantum Mechanics with Relativity by linking **Time** to **Information Processing Speed**.
* [cite_start]**The Theory:** Relativistic time dilation (slowing of time at high speeds or gravity) physically slows down the vibration rate of the Information Field[cite: 930].
* **The Prediction:** This means that a quantum system moving at high speeds effectively "thinks" slower. [cite_start]Its internal phase evolution is retarded, which paradoxically allows it to maintain quantum coherence (superposition) for much longer than a stationary system[cite: 976, 982]. This offers a new pathway to stable quantum computing via relativistic acceleration.

## 🕳️ Black Holes as "Frozen Information"
In the VIFT framework, the Black Hole Information Paradox is resolved by redefining the Event Horizon. [cite_start]The horizon is not a hole, but a **Vibration Sink**[cite: 932].
* [cite_start]As matter approaches the horizon, the extreme redshift forces the vibrational information modes to slow down until they effectively stop[cite: 986].
* [cite_start]The black hole is a region of **non-oscillatory information**—a hard drive where the data is written but cannot be read (vibrated) from the outside[cite: 898, 932].
