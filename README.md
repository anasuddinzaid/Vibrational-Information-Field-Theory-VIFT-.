## Theory Summary (Math-Free Explanation)

VIFT proposes that the deepest layer of reality is not spacetime, particles, or fields as traditionally defined, but a **universal vibrational information field** that acts as the substrate of all physical existence.

The theory argues that:

* The universe behaves like a **statistically biased resonance system**
* Physical laws are not arbitrary but emerge from **information-stability constraints**
* Matter is a **persistent low-loss vibration mode**
* Energy is **information excitation amplitude**
* Gravity is **macroscopic bias curvature of information density**
* Consciousness emerges when a system enters a **high-coherence, entropy-minimizing resonance state**
* Cosmological evolution resembles **vibration-node competition for stability**
* Collapse events are **information compression thresholds that seed new vibrational expansions**
* The universe exists because it is a **survivor of infinite vibrational pruning**
* Efficiency, least-action, entropy, and emergence are all expressions of **information-loss minimization**
* Dark energy may be a **low-frequency background information pressure**
* Multiverse interaction is modeled conceptually as **information isolation zones inside meta-void topology**

This paper forms the backbone of Anas’s deeper attempt to explain **why physics has structure at all**, rather than merely describing the structure itself.
